# Machine Learning Lab

This repository contains implementations of Machine Learning algorithms (along with the datasets used to demonstrate the said algorithms) in Python (.py and .ipynb both included)

#### This repository consists codes for:
 - Missing Value Analysis [Dataset Used: [pima-indian-diabetes.csv](https://github.com/IAmOZRules/Machine_Learning/blob/main/pima-indians-diabetes.csv)]
 - Min-Max Normalization [Dataset Used: [weight-height.csv](https://github.com/IAmOZRules/Machine_Learning/blob/main/weight-height.csv)]
 - Z-Score Transformation [Dataset Used: [weight-height.csv](https://github.com/IAmOZRules/Machine_Learning/blob/main/weight-height.csv)]
 - Simple Linear Regression [Dataset Used: [Salary_Data.csv](https://github.com/IAmOZRules/Machine_Learning/blob/main/Salary_Data.csv)]
 - Decision Tree Classification [Dataset Used: [UCI ML Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer.html)]
